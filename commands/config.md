**config show**: Read `.discovery-karaoke-config.yml` from the working directory at time of invocation. Display as:
> "Config loaded from: `[resolved path]/.discovery-karaoke-config.yml`"
followed by the config contents in readable format. If none exists:
> "No config found at `[resolved path]/.discovery-karaoke-config.yml`. Run `config save` to create one, or check if you're in the right directory."
